## Challenge 3

(Please submit your code on https://repl.it/, you will need to create a repl account or log in using your GitHub profile)

Write a program in any language that calculates the distance between two sets of coordinates (using libraries is fine). 

- Takes two sets of coordinates as inputs
- Outputs the distance in any units

Extra points for any additional features such as:

- Supports multiple units
- CLI
- User interface


## Shuai's Comment:

I believe this test intends to test me on how to choose design and scope and code accordingly.  Since there is little amount of time to spend on this, I chose the smallest scope possible. My answer is a very simple x, y coordinates calculation.  There are probably real life coordination calculation and would calculate the curvature of the Earth and maps libraries to find the best route, but I decided to go small.

Because of that I only created a simple HTML table with some javascript math attaching to it.   All you need to do to check my work is to drag the `calculate.html` file to any browser and start filling in the x-y coordinates.
